# Apple.com Design Clone

---
## Overview

The Apple.com Design Clone project is a static website created using HTML and CSS. It faithfully replicates the appearance and layout of the apple home page, including elements like the logo, search bar, buttons, and overall design.
It's essential to emphasize that this clone project serves purely educational and demonstrative purposes. I developed it as a personal exercise to enhance my HTML and CSS skills.
